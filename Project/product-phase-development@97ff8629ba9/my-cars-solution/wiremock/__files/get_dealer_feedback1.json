Not only does this car replace the CLA sedan in India, but with the new-gen CLA, and A- and B-Class hatchbacks ruled out for our market, the A-Class Limousine will be the most affordable offering wearing the three-pointed star.",

The 2022 Tucson is 6 inches longer than the outgoing model, and that translates to much more back-seat space and cargo room. The exterior is edgier and more distinctive, the cabin is far more upscale, and the infotainment system has a sleeker appearance. The suite of driver assistance features has also grown significantly.",
