                The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species
                and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for
                its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter
                underside. It is an apex predator, primarily preying on
                ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and
                generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large
                contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for
                prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their
                mother for about two years, before they become independent and
                leave their mother's home range to establish their own.

                The tiger was first scientifically described in 1758 and once
                ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to
                the Amur River basin in the east, and in the south from the
                foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda Islands. Since
                the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93%
                of their historic range and have been extirpated from Western
                and Central Asia, the islands of Java and Bali, and in large
                areas of Southeast and South Asia and China. Today, the tiger's
                range is fragmented, stretching from Siberian temperate forests
                to subtropical and tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent
                and Sumatra.

                The tiger is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. As of
                2015, the global wild tiger population was estimated to number
                between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals, with most of the
                populations living in small isolated pockets. India currently
                hosts the largest tiger population. Major reasons for population
                decline are habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and
                poaching. Tigers are also victims of humanâ€“wildlife conflict,
                particularly in range countries with a high human population
                density.
